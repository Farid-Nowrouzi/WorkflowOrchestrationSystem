/**
 * Represents a generic command in the workflow orchestration system.

 * <p>This interface defines a common contract for any command that can be
 * executed in the system, including actions like connecting nodes, deleting nodes,
 * executing them, etc.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is the base component of the Command design pattern, enabling
 * encapsulation of actions as first-class objects.</p>
 *
 * <p>It supports modularity, extensibility, and polymorphism by allowing
 * different command implementations to be executed uniformly.</p>
